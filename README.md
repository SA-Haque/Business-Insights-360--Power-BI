 ### Data Model
 - Data Modeling plays a vital role in Analysis and is considered as the basement of the report. All the analysis will be done, based on the data Model.
 - Poor data modeling will **lead to inaccurate analysis, slow performance, data redundancy, and difficulties in maintaining or scaling the system**. Refer to this: [What is Data Modeling](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/power-platform/products/power-bi/topics/data-modeling/what-is-data-modeling) for good Practice.
 - In this Project, we have followed the Snowflake Schema data model method --> [What is Snowflake Schema](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/snowflake-schema)
